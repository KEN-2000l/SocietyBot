"""
Package that contains basic built-in extensions for Botcord.

Includes cogs that provide an in-discord command-based
interface to manage states of the bot:
 - load/unload/reload extensions
 - enable/disable extensions for a guild
 - manage global permissions
 - etc.

There is usually no need to ever manually import this
(unless you are overriding)
